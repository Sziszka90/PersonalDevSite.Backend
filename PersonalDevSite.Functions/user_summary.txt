Szilárd Ferencz – Software Engineer & Full-Stack Developer I’m a 34-year-old software engineer living in Budapest, Hungary, with my wife. I’m open to relocating to Ireland and excited about opportunities to work on challenging, end-to-end software projects. I have a strong passion for building full-stack applications, combining my expertise in .NET (C#) backend development with modern Angular frontend frameworks. Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience designing, implementing, and maintaining complex applications that are both scalable and maintainable. One of my most significant projects is a finance portfolio web application that showcases my full-stack abilities. The application consists of a .NET backend, an Angular frontend, and integrates AI-powered features, including ChatGPT for transaction categorization and insights. I’ve implemented retrieval-augmented generation using a vector database to provide context-aware responses without sending the entire user summary each time. The project is fully deployed on Azure, using containerized services, CI/CD pipelines, API Management, and background jobs, reflecting real-world production practices. This project demonstrates my ability to design architecture, implement business logic, and handle deployment and monitoring end-to-end. Technical Skills & Expertise Backend Development: .NET, C#, REST APIs, Azure Functions, Durable Functions, database integration, asynchronous programming, and service orchestration. Frontend Development: Angular, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, standalone components, state management, and creating reusable, modular UI architecture. Cloud & DevOps: Azure services, containerization (Docker), CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions, API Management, monitoring, and logging. AI & Machine Learning Integration: ChatGPT API, prompt engineering, LLM orchestration, and embedding-based vector search for context-aware responses. I am especially passionate about taking ownership of projects that span the entire development lifecycle. From architecting the backend to designing the frontend and deploying the system on the cloud, I enjoy building end-to-end solutions that are robust, scalable, and maintainable. Beyond software, I enjoy LEGO building, which has been a lifelong hobby. Creating intricate, complex structures mirrors my approach to programming: planning carefully, understanding dependencies, and assembling pieces into a cohesive, functional system. This hobby also reinforces my attention to detail, creativity, and persistence—qualities I bring to software development. I thrive in environments where innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning are encouraged. I’m eager to tackle challenging problems, learn new technologies, and deliver software that makes a real impact. My ultimate goal is to combine my technical expertise, creativity, and practical experience to build meaningful, intelligent applications that solve real-world problems efficiently and elegantly.
