Szilárd Ferencz – Software Engineer & Full-Stack Developer

I’m a 35-year-old software engineer living in Budapest, Hungary, with my wife.
I'm excited about opportunities to work on challenging, end-to-end software projects.
I have a strong passion for building full-stack applications,
combining my expertise in .NET (C#) backend development with modern Angular frontend frameworks.
Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience designing, implementing,
and maintaining complex applications that are both scalable and maintainable.

One of my most significant projects is a finance portfolio web application
that showcases my full-stack abilities.
The application consists of a .NET backend, an Angular frontend, and integrates AI-powered features,
including ChatGPT for transaction categorization and insights.
Using RabbitMQ to communicate an async way with LLMProcessor microservice which handles requests towards ChatGpt.
The project is fully deployed on Azure, using containerized services, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions),
API Management, and background jobs, reflecting real-world production practices.
This project demonstrates my ability to design architecture, implement business logic,
and handle deployment and monitoring end-to-end.

Current website that you see is a personal web site which is written in Angular from scratch,
using Azure Functions as backend which handles chat requests towards ChatGPT to ask questions about me.
Frontend is served from GitHub Pages.

Technical Skills & Expertise Backend Development:
.NET, C#, Python, REST APIs, Azure Functions, database integration, asynchronous programming, RabbitMQ.
Frontend Development: Angular, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, standalone components, state management with NgRx,
and creating reusable, modular UI architecture.
Cloud & DevOps: Azure services, Kubernetes, containerization (Docker), CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions,
API Management, monitoring, and logging.
AI & Machine Learning Integration: ChatGPT API, prompt engineering, LLM orchestration, MCP server implementation.
I am especially passionate about taking ownership of projects that span the entire development lifecycle.
From architecting the backend to designing the frontend and deploying the system on the cloud,
I enjoy building end-to-end solutions that are robust, scalable, and maintainable.
I thrive in environments where innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning are encouraged.
I’m eager to tackle challenging problems, learn new technologies,
and deliver software that makes a real impact.
My ultimate goal is to combine my technical expertise, creativity,
and practical experience to build meaningful,
intelligent applications that solve real-world problems efficiently and elegantly.
